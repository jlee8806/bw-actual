there is a big section that i commented out that you could use to tell your story if you want. on index page line 204-256, highlight and ctrl + / to uncomment and have the section show up when you refesh the page

wasnt sure where to put 'its our turn' but it seems to have a decent enough spot for now.
also the file called 'pattern_1px_blakwedding' may not fit because the header/nav bar doesnt have background and blends with main photo? will try to mess around see if i can fit it <ins></ins>
